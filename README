Project
+ Similar to wireshark, I want to track individual connections and headers of
  these connections: IP, TCP headers and its payload
+ After tracking connections, build a profile for each individual connection and
  create a heuristic per connection stating its maliciousness or normality

Tasks
+ Fine-tine an LLM on payload data from connections
	+ Take the simple case of HTTP first, telnet, nc, etc. Not encrypted.
+ Train LLM to determine 'malicious' traffic, or traffic out of the norm
+ Log format that shows node-to-node connections

Done
+ Create a connections object
+ Track individual connection headers: IP, TCP, protocol and packet count
+ Print simple statistics of each connection
+ TCPDump for incoming packets: Offset, HEX and ASCII values
+ Collect each connections payload and save to a file or another data structure

Project
+ Similar to wireshark, I want to track individual connections and headers of
  these connections: IP, TCP headers and its payload
+ After tracking connections, build a profile for each individual connection and
  create a heuristic per connection

Tasks
+ Track bipartite connections
+ Improve output screen when cancelling the sniffer
+ Log-format write to disk of all connections

Done
+ Create a connections object
+ Track individual connection headers: IP, TCP, protocol and packet count
+ Print simple statistics of each connection
+ TCPDump for incoming packets: Offset, HEX and ASCII values
+ Collect each connections payload and save to a file or another data structure
